Train a neural network to recognize cells from a static or dynamic feed and count them. The approach can be classified as a supervised learning one of the two major machine learning classifications. The first step ideal will be to collect and process the datasets in a way that is relatively easy for the computer to understand using image processing among other techniques. Secondly the neural network will be trained with the necessary requirements, a GPU enabled computer and the transformed dataset.  

**Note**: Several minor modifications are made when reimplementing the framework, which give potential improvements. For details about the modifications and ablative analysis, please refer to the technical report [An Implementation of Faster RCNN with Study for Region Sampling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.02138.pdf). If you are seeking to reproduce the results in the original paper, please use the [official code](https://github.com/ShaoqingRen/faster_rcnn) or maybe the [semi-official code](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn).
